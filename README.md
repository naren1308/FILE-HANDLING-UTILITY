**This Java program allows users to perform three basic file operations: 1.Write to a file (overwrites existing content). 2.Read from a file (displays content). 3.Append to a file (adds content without overwriting). The program utilizes Java's file handling classes from the java.io package, specifically FileWriter for writing and appending data, FileReader for reading from the file, and BufferedReader for efficiently handling large amounts of text. The Scanner class is used to take user input, allowing users to enter their choices and text. To ensure smooth execution, the program implements exception handling using try-catch blocks, preventing crashes in case of missing files or permission issues. The menu repeats in a loop until the user decides to exit. While functional, this program could be improved by allowing users to specify file names dynamically, checking for empty files before reading, and enhancing the user interface with better formatting and prompts.
